Franziska is a numerical macroecologist based in Nottingham, UK 

## Collaboration statement
My work focuses on the application of remote sensing, machine learning and non-linear statistical tools to study biogeochemical patterns. I am especially interested in plant functional trait - environment correlations and associated implications for ecosystem structure and functioning.

I can offer expertise in robust inference of missing traits and multivariate trait diversity measures. I am also happy to help connect people together around traits by running working groups, hosting visitors in my lab and organising symposia at conferences. For example, I gave a workshop on trait imputation at one of the British Ecological Society macroecology meetings based on the machine learning method I co-developed: https://github.com/fisw10/BHPMF
