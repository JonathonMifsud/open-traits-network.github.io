## Collaboration statement
My work centres around plant trait data; from field collection, dataset development, through to analysis and publication. My specific focus is on leaf traits, including biochemical, physiological and spectral traits.  

I am currently working on development of a data and metadata standard for leaf-level gas exchange measurements (i.e. measurements of photosynthetic rates and related parameters). I am very interesting in incorporating existing trait standards and ontologies, and then building a standard with a more comprehensive coverage of these type of data that currently exists (to the extent of my knowledge).
