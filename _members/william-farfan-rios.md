William is a plant ecologist based in Saint Louis, MO, USA.

## Collaboration statement
I am interested in the study of plant communitiesâ€™ composition, dynamics, distribution, and their responses to global change. I have been coordinating and leading field campaigns and research projects in the Andean-Amazonian elevational transect established by the Andes Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group. Currently, I am integrating data of long-term forest inventories and functional traits across the Andes-to-Amazon elevational gradients to explore the effects of climate change on tropical biodiversity and ecosystem processes.

I can offer expertise in data management, combining them with trait data. I am also happy to help connect people around traits by running working groups at WashU and MOBOT.
